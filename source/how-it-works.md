# How it works

Fraudrankr is a hosted web service that save you time by automatically detecting
fraud. It's hosted on our cloud-based servers, but we give you access to it
through REST API.

<div id="container" style="width: 545px; height: 350px; margin: 0 auto"></div>

Fraudrankr collects all events that you provide to it and analyzes and compares
patterns with known fraud patterns. Before accepting an e-commerce transaction
you may ask Fraudrankr for a fraud Score of a given client, and then accept or
reject the fraudulent customer.
